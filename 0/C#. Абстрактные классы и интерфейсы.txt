An abstract class is a way to achieve the abstraction in C#. An Abstract class is never intended to be instantiated directly. This class must contain at least one abstract method, which is marked by the keyword or modifier abstract in the class definition. The Abstract classes are typically used to define a base class in the class hierarchy.

Like a class, Interface can have methods, properties, events, and indexers as its members. But interfaces will contain only the declaration of the members. The implementation of interfaceâ€™s members will be given by the class who implements the interface implicitly or explicitly.
